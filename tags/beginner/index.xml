      <description>Game Solver With the Game and it&amp;rsquo;s logic properly set, we can now move on to creating a Game Solver &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo;. In this case, our AI will be a simple optimizing algorithm. One of the reasons, I created this project is to teach myself how to make Game AI, later on involving Deep Learning but a good way to develop intuition is to solve a small scale problem such as here.</description>

      <description>Game Logic Having built our basic board structure, we can create and implement the game logic on top of the existing data structure that is our board. Despite no apparent need for putting the Game Logic in a class, I shall do so to make sure I&amp;rsquo;m writing clean OOP code. This will enable us to import the methods neatly later on , makes the code readable and ensures structural integrity even in a place where it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary.</description>

      <description>Sudoku Game Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid [also called &amp;ldquo;boxes&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;blocks&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;regions&amp;rdquo;] contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.</description>
